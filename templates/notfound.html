                    "Software Developer-
                    I am an experienced software engineer, with a passion for developing new products. I started my career with Infosys, mostly working on Oracle ERP supply chain modules.
                    My technical work involves comprehensive knowledge on database and server handling. Having said this, currently I'm a software developer for Dell's industry- leading supply chain, with expertise on Oracle application development and integration tools."
