                    I have been working as an IT Professional for 3 years now. Acting and dance have always been my passion and I have been focusing on training lately to take them professionally.
                    So i am trained in odissi for more than 7 years in my childhood and currently am again getting trained from the scratch in odissi and also am getting trained in hiphop, and few other styles.
                    As per acting, i have done many theatres during my college days and got trained under NSD passout teacher and now recently i also got trained under anupam kher acting school- actor's prepares.
                    I strongly believe if you truly want to do something with your passion you can always have ways to do them even if you have a full time job. Sheer determination, focus , hardwork and proper guidance are the pillars to that.
                    I hope i will be able to guide people who are looking forward to take acting or dance as passion or hobby or professionally.
