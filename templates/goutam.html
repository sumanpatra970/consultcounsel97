                    I am currently pursuing my masters from Indian Institute of Space science and Technology-Thiruvananthapuram, in the field of Solid-State Technology.
                    The field particularly focuses on physics of solid-state devices like thin film transistors and various challenges to design next generation devices.
                    Since the channel length of transistors have kept on decreasing in order to fit more transistors in a chip, which results more processing power, we have reached a bottleneck where the quantum effects tend to dominate.
                    Hence there is a requirement of engineers with solid knowledge of quantum mechanics and solid-state physics in order to overcome this effect and design new devices.
                    My current masterâ€™s thesis though focusses on completely different field, i.e. the quantum information theory and quantum optical communications. These are relatively new fields, which are closely related to quantum computers.
                    Together these 3 form the basis of quantum technologies, where we exploit the fundamental laws of nature as described by quantum mechanics in order make next gen computers.
                    Quantum optical communications form an exciting new field because using concepts of quantum optics we can create secured communications which help us detect the presence of eavesdropper in a definite way.
                    This is in contrast to classical cryptography which relies on impossibility of classical computers to decode a secured message based on computation power alone.
                    Quantum cryptography, which forms integral part of quantum optical communications however relies of fundamental laws of nature to prevent any possible eavesdropping by definitely showing the presence of eavesdropper.
                    I have done by Bachelors in Electronics and Telecommunication engineering from VSSUT Burla.
