                    As a full stack developer, I designed, developed, tested, deployed and maintained a web application, which helps users for
                    spreading financial statements of different corporations.
                    Built the UI from scratch using ReactJS and AG-grid.
                    Coded end-to-end functionalities of the application by using Java 8 (Sprint Boot). Developed services and corresponding
                    REST endpoints, wrote Unit tests and parallelly worked on the UI component of the functionality.
                    Developed a service, which remotely monitors production server health from application logs and sends alerts, using splunk and spring boot actuator.
