                    Professionally, I am a Business Analyst who is keen on Fitness and Arts. I believe that Health is the most precious asset of every human being and everyone should learn how to earn a healthy lifestyle.
                    Gym is the temple for me where I meditate. I often share my workout videos and healthy recipes on my social media accounts to motivate people.
                    I run an online customized handmade jewelry business "Anjali Jewellery Creations" to employ and empower socially and economically backward women.
                    The lockdown due to Covid-19 made me start my long-awaited cooking channel in YouTube "Annie Potter's Kitchen", which is beneficial for the young generation.
                    My friends consider me as an one-stop platform for all the household chores. Be it cooking, gardening, crafting or repairing switchboards and connections, I could be a solution.
                    I love to hold the paint brush and express my thoughts on the canvas. I grow organic tomatoes, bell peppers and herbs in my balcony and air purifying plants in my bedroom.
                    I often share videos on how to take care of common plants and herbs in my social media accounts.
                    I believe that sharing positive thoughts among people would definitely make a positive difference in their lives.
