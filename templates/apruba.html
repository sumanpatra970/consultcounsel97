                    A little background on my life through FOOD. More than just something to nourish your body, food can foster the perfect environment for memories and special times!
                    Before diving deep into food writing, or even content writing, I was a voracious reader. My nose would always be buried in a book & it gave me immense pleasure. If reading could, why couldn't writing? Thus my journey of a writer began!
                    I have ghost-written for TOI, Amazon, Snapdeal, Tata and so many other brand. Soon after, I decided to take up academic & business writing and I ended up having a certification from UCI Davis, California.
                    When I'm not writing or consulting on Digital marketing, I spend most of her time reading, curating recipes, traveling the world.
