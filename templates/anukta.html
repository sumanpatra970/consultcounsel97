                    If I had to say something about me, I would say I am passionate about dancing, acting and trying to bud my way through content creation.
                    I started learning classical dance since the time I can remember, I have been trained in it as well. I have been fortunate enough to be able to showcase my talent at multiple platforms and grateful for all the opportunities.
                    Apart from dancing, I enjoy acting as well. The interest started when I joined my bachelor's degree. The environment was very nurturing and I thoroughly enjoyed my short experience with acting.
                    I have not learnt acting but surely have performed, with just a few awards.
                    I am honoured that you considered me for this.
