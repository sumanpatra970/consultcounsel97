                    You can get the max out of your engineering studies, if you get to do it in person.
                    I am a mechanical engineer and currently I am working as Assistant Manager at Vedanta ltd. (Bharat aluminium Company limited). I am a Mechanical maintenance engineer over there. I attend to machine breakdowns on daily basis as a maintenance shift Incharge.
                    Further more, I am into spare parts procurement and planning, with close association with SAP HANA for planning, compliance and asset optimisation.
