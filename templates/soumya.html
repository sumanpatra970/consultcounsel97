                    Fascinated with the beauty all around her, she started painting at the age of 3 and never stopped after that. She  likes to try various art mediums, and experiment with different thoughts and ideas.
                    Nature is her muse, and her brush is her wand. She believes anyone can pick up a brush and paint their world the colour they want.
                    Currently, she is pursuing her MBA. She is looking forward to building a community where everyone can draw and paint their imagination and develop art as a hobby as well as a stress-burster!
