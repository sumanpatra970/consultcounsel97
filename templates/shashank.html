                    Hello! I'm Shashank Puranik. I'm a post-graduate student in Engineering at King's College London. I completed my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from R.N.S Institute of Technology, Bangalore.
                    I have been trained in the South Indian classical tradition of playing the bamboo flute. I started my training at the age of seven. I had the privilege to start learning under one of the renowned flautists in Karnataka and continued advanced training under my gurus Sikkil Mala Chandrasekhar and Padmasri A. Kanyakumari.
                    My accomplishments in this area can be attested by the bestowal of the national scholarship conferred to young artists by the Ministry of Culture, India. I am also a recognised, graded artist of All India Radio, Prasara Bharati, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India.
                    My association with this beautiful instrument spans over a decade and has imparted more than just the skill in playing it.
                    Along with the comfort it brings me, it continues to teach me certain critical skills that are necessary from an academic point of view as well.
                    With the blessing of my Gurus, I've performed in many prestigious sabhas and venues across South India.
