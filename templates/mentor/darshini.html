                <p class="textsize">
                    Truth be told, Darshini wears several hats. The kind who would strike highly engaging awkward conversations to lighten up the room with your laughter & hers. No not a comic, rather a poetess who pens down her free writings on instagram occassionally.
                    She loves cooking poetry in her head, mostly personalized & women centric. Darshini lives with her cats, neatly organized novels & an overpacked colourful wardrobe. You can also find her sketching occassionally and baking like it's Christmas.
                    When one thinks of Darshini, one thinks of sunflower. ðŸŒ»
